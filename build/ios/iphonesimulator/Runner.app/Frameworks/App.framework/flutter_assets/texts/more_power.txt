## Naturally aspirated
It may seem that 200 to 220 HP is good for a 4-cylinder 2.2-liter engine, but you can get even better results. Let’s decide what motor is best for starting tuning – H22A Redtop or H22A Blacktop. It doesn’t matter, you will still have to replace camshafts and do the cylinder head porting, the result will be the same. The first stage is the repairing the engine, most likely your engine is completely worn and requires repair, so have it repaired. Then buy cold air intake system, H22A Euro R intake manifold, a throttle body (68-70 mm), 4-2-1 headers and a 2.5″ exhaust system. This will be enough to make the old Honda H22 bring you more fun. There is no point trying to obtain more power, you will waste you money, as any modern 2-liter turbocharged engine with dual-clutch transmission will be faster. But if you’re really obsessed, let’s go further. Now you need to do head porting. Even if you have a H22A Red top with serial porting, they had done it at the primary level. You have to make good porting; the diameter of the intake and exhaust valves may be left standard (35/30 mm). Now you have to remove the balancer shafts and close the oil line to them. It would be nice to increase the compression ratio; this would require Type S pistons (compression ratio 11). You can leave standard piston rods, but it is better and safer to have lighter ones installed. Do not forget about new valves, bronze valve guides, titanium retainers, Skunk2 PRO2 cams, cam gears, Skunk2 valve springs, 360 cc fuel injectors, and ECU Hondata. Once configured, all these aftermarket parts together can provide about 250 HP at the flywheel. That’s still not enough? Then you have to increase the compression ratio to 14, find a suitable stroker kit, buy ITB kit, water/methanol injection systems, the most dynamic shafts and get 9,000+ rpm. However, it is less expensive to buy an S2000, or even a faster car.

## Turbo
There is no point in thinking of building a turbocharged H22A using stock internals, it is a weak engine, and you need forged pistons and rods. First of all, you need Darton sleeves, forged pistons (compression ratio <9), Eagle H-Beam rods, ACL rod bearings and ACL main bearings. Balancer shafts are to be removed. Such an engine is ready for installation of a turbokit based on Garrett T04e turbocharger (or something similar). To make everything work properly, buy a turbo manifold, an intercooler, an HKS BOV valve, ARP head studs, a Walbro 255 fuel pump, a 3-row radiator, an aftermarket fuel rail, 680 cc/min fuel injectors, a fuel pressure regulator, a MAP sensor, piping kit, the 3 inch exhaust system, a wideband air/fuel oxygen sensor, and a Hondata ECU. You also have to install an oil feed line to the turbocharger, and an oil return line. After installation of all these mods and configuration of the ECU, you will get about 350 HP at the flywheel with the boost pressure of 15 psi (1 bar). You can port and polish your cylinder head, buy sports valves, valve springs, and valve guides. These upgrades will improve performance and add reliability.
